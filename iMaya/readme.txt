DESCRIPTION
------------
What happens if you cross artificial intelligence with 3D

This Project will make the attempt to cross artificial intelligence Algorythms and common 3D workflow. Usually many operations in 3D workflow are highly retundant and often actions have to be repeaded several times or instead being executed in selfmade scripts.Scripting is in fact for most people a very nasty and time consuming action.
This application module tries to fill the gap where it lerns workflows which can in order be modified, multiplied, adapted organically to allow a fast and versatile Workflows, where currently rigit working habits will not Compete.
...also making scripting finally obsolete.
currently the developement is started with Autodesk Maya. More 3D platforms will come after this project is succeding.
